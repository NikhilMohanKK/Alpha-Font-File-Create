This Python Program helps you to locate all the fonts present in your system and use 
those fonts to create images of all the characters with the appropriate fonts using blob libraries.
The program would locate the fonts automatically and use each font to generate 
.png file images holding each character letters and numbers and store it on seperately created folders.




This program would be helpful in collecting datasets for the english character set 
in various fonts and creating specific dimensional fonted png images which could be 
used in character recognition in photo OCR problem.
